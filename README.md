## üõ†Ô∏è Theme Setup and Error Fix Summary

This version of the Aurora Framework has resolved critical PHP issues caused by duplicate function declarations (`aurora_theme_setup()` and `aurora_enqueue_assets()`). Functions have now been modularized correctly and wrapped in `function_exists()` to prevent future redeclaration errors.

### ‚úÖ Fixed:
- `aurora_theme_setup()` is now defined only in `inc/setup.php`
- `aurora_enqueue_assets()` is now defined only in `inc/scripts.php`
- All modular files are safely included via `functions.php`
- Error-safe coding practices like `function_exists()` are used
- The theme is now safe to activate and fully functional

This commit ensures clean code architecture and prepares the framework for Gutenberg customization and language switcher integration.
